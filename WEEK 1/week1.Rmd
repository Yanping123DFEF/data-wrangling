## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## Some Notes on Flights

In this document, we will:

* Try some markdown code, including 
    + headers
    + items
* Include some inline R code
* Include a plot

The flights data.frame in the nycflights13 package has data on `r nrow(flights)` flights. Some of the flights have missing data, denoted by "NA". That means if we type
```{r}
mean(flights$dep_delay)
```
the answer is NA, as shown above.

Instead, type
```{r}
mean(flights$dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
```
(The mean function has an option called na.rm that, when set to TRUE, will remove NAs and then calculate the mean.) 

The mean flight delay is `r mean(flights$dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE)`. The distribution of delays can be visualized with a histogram, shown below,


```{r chunk1, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = flights) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(dep_delay))
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = flights) + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(dep_delay), bins = 50)
```

or as a density plot.

```{r density}
ggplot(data = flights) + geom_density(mapping = aes(dep_delay)) 
```


It's important to note that your R code either goes inside the triple ticks, \`\`\`, or the single tick, \`, and don't forget the "r".
